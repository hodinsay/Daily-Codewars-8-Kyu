// Returning Strings_short

// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

// Solution 1: 

const greet = name => "Hello, " + name + " how are you doing today?";

// Solution 2:

const greet = name => `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
